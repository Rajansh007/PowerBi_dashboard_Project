Timeline Analysis of Covid19
This is end to end project for Power BI where I have created the dashboard showing spread of Covid19 cases. 

This dashboard offers a deep dive into the progression of the pandemic over time, providing valuable insights and trends that can aid in understanding the spread of the virus, its impact on different regions, and the effectiveness of mitigation measures.

Key features include:
🔍 Interactive visualizations for easy data exploration
🌍 Global and regional perspectives for comparative analysis
⏰ Temporal trends to track changes over time
